                            <b>Minority representation</b>
                            <p> A district is categorized as a minority opportunity district if one of the following 
                                conditions are satisfied:
                            </p>
                            <p>- At least 53% of the district's population is of a racial minority. The additional 
                                3% above the majority-minority baseline is necessary to ensure that minority voters 
                                are able to elect a candidate of their choice, even if their turnout is depressed.
                            </p>
                            <p>- At least 53% of the district's vote share in a 50-50 national environment goes 
                                towards Democrats, and minority voters make up a majority of the Democrats' voter 
                                base so that they can elect their desired candidate in the primary.
                            </p>
                            <p>Currently, my algorithm assumes that 80% of minority votes are for Democrats 
                                regardless of geographic location (which has a significant effect on how people vote). 
                                I based this estimate off of the 
                                <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2018/08/09/an-examination-of-the-2016-electorate-based-on-validated-voters/">
                                    2016 national exit polls,
                                </a> in which roughly 79% of minority voters voted for Clinton, and the 
                                <a href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/exit-polls/president/national-results">
                                    2020 national exit polls,
                                </a> in which roughly 74% of minority voters voted for Biden.
                                In the future, this can be improved upon by using an ecological interference model 
                                to estimate how individual minority groups voted in each precinct. This will give a 
                                much more accurate result than assuming every minority group gives the same share 
                                of their votes to Democrats.

                            <b>Polsby-Popper</b>
                            <p>Suppose a certain district has perimeter P. Then the Polsby-Popper score for that 
                                district is the ratio of the area of that district to the area of a circle that 
                                also has perimeter P. See 
                                <a href="http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.13051/17448">this article</a>
                                for more information.
                            </p>
                            <p>Unusually low Polsby-Popper scores may be an indicator of long, snaking districts 
                                that are highly gerrymandered. However, every score must be taken in context with 
                                the rest of the ensemble. For example, a district that includes Michigan's Upper 
                                Peninsula naturally has an extremely low Polsby-Popper score, as it needs to take 
                                in a lot of small, jagged islands, as well as the rough Upper Peninsula itself.

                            <b>Expected Democrat seats</b>
                            <p>The probability of a Democrat winning in each district is calculated using two 
                                normal distributions overlaid on top of each other. The first normal 
                                distribution is centered around the Democratic vote share in the district and has 
                                standard deviation 0.03, representing cycle-level differences in the Democratic 
                                vote share. The second normal distribution is centered at points drawn from 
                                the first normal distribution, has standard deviation 0.02, and represents 
                                district-level variations in the Democratic vote share. The expected number of 
                                seats won by Democrats is the sum of all of these values throughout each district.  
                                This works by Linearity of Expectation, a mathematical property that allows us to 
                                ignore the fact that Democratic vote shares in the same election cycle are 
                                correlated with each other.
                            </p>
                            <p>This is essentially a simplified version of the Bayesian hierarchical model used by 
                                <a href="https://planscore.org/models/data/2022F/">PlanScore</a> to calculate the 
                                probability of each party winning an election in each district. The largest 
                                difference is that this simplified version recenters the Democratic vote based on 
                                the partisan lean of the overall election (explained in the "Boxplot" section).

            <h2>Boxplot</h2>
            <p>Here, the red line denotes the "lean" of the election to adjust for overly strong elections 
                for either party. For presidential elections, this "lean" is the Democratic two-party vote 
                share nationally, while for gubernatorial elections, this "lean" is the state's partisan lean 
                (calculated by averaging the Democratic two-party vote share in the two most recent 
                presidential elections after adjusting for the national vote share) subtracted from Democratic 
                two-party vote share.
            </p>
            <p>All districts displayed are sorted from lowest to highest Democratic vote share. The red dots 
                represent the Democratic vote shares of districts in the initial plan.
            </p>
            <p>One sign of gerrymandering is if there is a suspicious absence of red points close to the red line. 
                Points within 5 percentage points of this red line (or 0.05 on the plot) are considered to be 
                competitive districts, meaning that both parties have a significant chance of winning elections 
                held in this district. Thus, a plan with a lack of these districts means that elections under this 
                plan are largely predetermined: that is, one party's dominance in each district is nearly guaranteed.
            </p>
            <p>We can also compare the red points to the boxplots' positions. If a large proportion of the red points 
                are outliers, especially if they lie further away from the red line than the boxplot does whenever 
                the boxplot is close to the red line, there's a high chance that the starting plan was drawn with 
                partisan interests in mind.
