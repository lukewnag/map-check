            <h2>Boxplot</h2>
            <p>Here, the red line denotes the "lean" of the election to adjust for overly strong elections 
                for either party. For presidential elections, this "lean" is the Democratic two-party vote 
                share nationally, while for gubernatorial elections, this "lean" is the state's partisan lean 
                (calculated by averaging the Democratic two-party vote share in the two most recent 
                presidential elections after adjusting for the national vote share) subtracted from Democratic 
                two-party vote share.
            </p>
            <p>All districts displayed are sorted from lowest to highest Democratic vote share. The red dots 
                represent the Democratic vote shares of districts in the initial plan.
            </p>
            <p>One sign of gerrymandering is if there is a suspicious absence of red points close to the red line. 
                Points within 5 percentage points of this red line (or 0.05 on the plot) are considered to be 
                competitive districts, meaning that both parties have a significant chance of winning elections 
                held in this district. Thus, a plan with a lack of these districts means that elections under this 
                plan are largely predetermined: that is, one party's dominance in each district is nearly guaranteed.
            </p>
            <p>We can also compare the red points to the boxplots' positions. If a large proportion of the red points 
                are outliers, especially if they lie further away from the red line than the boxplot does whenever 
                the boxplot is close to the red line, there's a high chance that the starting plan was drawn with 
                partisan interests in mind.
            </p>
