                To build districts in each ensemble, this algorithm uses Monte Carlo Markov Chains, implemented 
                by the Gerrychain library. Monte Carlo Markov Chains combine the Monte Carlo method, which 
                draws random samples to form an estimate of the probability distribution, with Markov Chains, 
                which use the previous outcome to generate a new outcome. When the Markov Chain's new outcomes 
                have low correlation with the previous outcome, the probability distribution it produces is 
                more representative of random sampling, so a Monte Carlo Markov Chain can produce a very close 
                approximation to the probability distribution of a completely random ensemble. More details can 
                be found in Dr. Daryl DeFord's 
                <a href="https://www.math.wsu.edu/faculty/ddeford/MCMC_Intro_plus.pdf">tutorial</a>.

                Sometimes, a state's electoral map is so skewed that any set of districts that has any 
                correlation at all with the original map is biased as well. To ensure that districts in the 
                computer-generated ensemble are independent of the initial state (the state's electoral map), 
                we use the Recombination method, which produces outcomes with far lower correlation with the 
                initial state. The essence of this algorithm is to combine two adjacent districts, draw a minimum 
                spanning tree, then sever a single connection in this tree to separate these two districts again. 
                Details on this method can be found on the Metric Geometry and Gerrymandering Group's
