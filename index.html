                <p>Electoral districts are redrawn after each new Census taken at the end of every 
                    decade to reflect changes in population. The drawing of electoral maps is often done 
                    by state legislatures, many of which partake in a process known as "gerrymandering."
                </p>
                <p>Gerrymandering is the unfair drawing of electoral districts with the intention of 
                    promoting the voice of one segment of the population at the expense of others. 
                    Sometimes, it involves long, snaking districts that capture particular groups of 
                    voters. At other times, gerrymandered rural districts swoop into cities to dilute urban 
                    voters' voices. Either way, gerrymandered maps split up communities and make it more 
                    difficult for those communities' interests to be heard in each state's legislature 
                    and the halls of Congress.
                </p>

                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>One of the first documented uses of gerrymandering took place in 1812, when Massachusetts 
                    Governor Elbridge Gerry signed into law a new set of electoral districts for the 
                    Massachusetts Senate that linked together scattered pockets of supporters of the 
                    Democratic-Republican Party.
                </p>
                <p>One of the winding districts was said to resemble a mythological salamander, earning this 
                    kind of districting the moniker "Gerrymander."
                </p>
                <img src="./img/original_gerrymander.png" alt="The original gerrymander">
                <p>In the 20th century, gerrymandering was used in tandem with voter suppression tactics in 
                    the Jim Crow South to silence the voices of minority voters and others with viewpoints 
                    those in power considered "unfavorable." To combat this, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 
                    included a provision requiring certain jurisdictions to seek preclearance with federal 
                    officials regarding their electoral district boundaries.
                </p>

                <h2>What about now?</h2>
                <p>In 2010, the Republicans had a very favorable election, giving them full control over the 
                    drawing of 213 out of 435 congressional districts. The effects were immediate: in 2012, 
                    despite the Democrats garnering 1.4 million more votes than Republicans, they only won 201 
                    seats, compared to the Republicans' 234 seats.
                </p>
                <p>Democrat-controlled states created similarly effective gerrymanders. In Maryland, Democrats 
                    redrew the state's Congressional map to contain seven Democratic-leaning seats and just 
                    a single Republican-leaning seat.
                </p>
                <p>Either way, gerrymandering sharply reduces the number of districts that could hold a 
                    competitive election, which makes election results almost predetermined. And because the 
                    public would no longer be able to hold politicians accountable, elected politicians have 
                    less incentive to be responsive to their voters. This leads to more political fighting and 
                    less work done on behalf of the people.
                </p>

                <h2>How can we stop it?</h2>
                <p>States such as Colorado and Virginia have created citizens' redistricting commissions, which 
                    are independent of partisan state legislatures. Similar reforms have been passed through state 
                    legislatures, while others were passed by popular referendums.
                </p>
                <p>Unfortunately, not every reform works. For example, despite an anti-gerrymandering referendum 
                    passing in Ohio, its Congressional districts are still highly gerrymandered: in a state where 
                    Democrats attain 46% of the vote on average, they can win 33% of its Congressional seats in a 
                    good year... and just 13% of its Congressional seats in a bad year.
                </p>
                <p>Lawsuits against states with gerrymandered Congressional and state legislature maps are another 
                    method used to fight gerrymandering. Such lawsuits tend to focus on violations of the Voting 
                    Rights Act and unfairly partisan outcomes in elections, which they prove by using a computer 
                    to generate a large ensemble of maps. This website aims to provide an inside look at this 
                    process by showcasing metrics commonly used in court, as well as a few original ones that 
                    evaluate partisan fairness.
